# Quantitative-Finance: Volatility Backtest

## Introduction
Volatility Portfolio Backtesting is a process used to evaluate the effectiveness of investment strategies that rely on the volatility factor. The volatility factor is based on the idea that assets that have exhibited high levels of volatility in the past are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, while assets that have exhibited low levels of volatility are likely to continue to be stable.

### Volatility Factor
The volatility factor is a market anomaly that suggests that assets that have exhibited high levels of volatility in the past are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, while assets that have exhibited low levels of volatility are likely to continue to be stable. This factor is based on the idea that investors tend to overreact to news and events, resulting in sudden price changes that create high levels of volatility.

### Volatility Portfolio
A volatility portfolio is a portfolio of assets that have exhibited high levels of volatility over a given time period. These portfolios are constructed by selecting assets that have demonstrated high levels of volatility over the past several months or years.

### Backtesting Methodology
Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy using historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. In this section, we will discuss the methodology used in backtesting the volatility portfolio, including the calculation of portfolio returns and risk metrics.
